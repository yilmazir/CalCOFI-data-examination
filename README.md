# CalCOFI-data-examination
This analysis focuses on exploring the linear relationship between the 'Distance' and 'Bottom_D' variables in the calCOFI's cast.csv dataset. By examining how the spatial 'Distance' from a station correlates with the 'Bottom_D' (bottom depth) during oceanographic casts, we aim to uncover patterns in ocean depth. Statistical methods such as data cleaning, NA elimination, one and two varibake analysis' and liner regression models will be employed to quantify and visualize the strength of this relationship.The project outcomes will offer valuable insights into understanding and evaulating the relationship.
